                    my interest in 3D printing is mostly derived from the ability to produce unique or useful items granted by the technology.
                    The photo of Alexander the Great represents a blending of my interest in art, history, and technology.            
                    The photos of the Camelback are one example of the problem solving ability of a 3D printer. When I was gifted a Camelback, 
                    which is essentially a backpack that carries water in a blue pouch, I faced the challenge of keeping the water pouch clean.
                    After use, the pouch should be dryed for cleanliness' sake, but the surface tension of the water makes this difficult by pulling
                    the plastic walls of the pouch together, trapping moisture. My solution was to go to 
                    <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/">www.thingiverse.com</a>,
                    a repository for free 3D models meant to be printed. A quick search brought me directly to what I was looking for.
                    Somebody had modeled and uploaded 
                    <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5243980">this model</a>,
                    which I was able to download, slice (create the instructions to be given to the printer), and begin printing.
                    The process of discovering an issue to getting the instructions for the 3D printer, took all of 10 minutes. After that, the
                    3D print can begin. This specific print took just over an hour to complete. and left me with a solution as seen below:
