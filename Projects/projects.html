                <p class="cell small-12 medium-6 large-6"> A few years ago I decided to switch my browser from Google Chrome to Mozilla Firefox. I had been using 
                    Chrome for as long as I can remember surfing the web, but Firefox became more appealing for a variety of reasons. When I decided to make this move,
                    I wanted to make Firefox feel like my own browser, and one of the most successful steps I took in persuit of this task was to download the 
                    <a href = "https://darktrojan.github.io/newtabtools/"><i>New Tab Tools</i> Extension</a>. 
                    Using this extension, I am able to add icons and links to my new tab for all of my favorite and most commonly used webpages. Having this tool 
                    yield great benefits for me in the form of easier organization, less mental fatigue and a generally more pleasent browsing experience. 
                    I really enjoy opening a new tab and seeing a completely customized page. I am able to exercise my creativity and I was even able to design 
                    quite a few icons for links like the UST Outlook, Calendar, Canvas, Murphy, and

                <p class="cell small-12 medium-4 large-4">This project was done as a part of a landscaping job I had in the Summer of 2021. 
                    Like most people, my Summer plans had been disrupted by COVID-19, and so I was in need of a new job. I went online and 
                    found people in my town looking for landscaping work. I contacted a potential customer and later met up to discuss what 
                    they were hoping to do in their yard. Their idea was to build flowerbeds in order to frame their house more distinctly.
                    The pictures above provide a glimpse into our process, which started by laying out a border, removing the grass within 
                    that border, and then filling the interior of the border in with dirt to raise the bed.

                <p class="cell small-12 medium-4 large-4"> Next, The stones which made up the border had to be put into place permanently. 
                    This was accomplished by mixing and pouring a layer of concrete around the outermost interior 8 inches of the border,
                    which the stones could then be placed on. This had the result of fixing the border in place, and together with additional
                    dirt laid on top of the cured concrete, the border was not going anywhere. Next up, the selection and placement of plants
                    and other landscaping features.

                <p class="cell small-12 medium-4 large-4"> Plants were selected to compliment eachother and the rest of the landscaping, and 
                    were given ample room to grow. Once they had their position determined, a layer of anti-weed tarp was laid over the dirt, 
                    holes were cut out in that tarp for the plants, and finally they were planted. The plants are joined by large decorative rocks
                    and two types of mulch. This finished the work and all that was left was to water the plants for the first time. Luckily, 
                    watering this new flowerbed brought out the colors of the border stones, the decorative rocks and cleaned up the burm in general.
