                    I am seeking a degree in Computer Science, as well as a minor in Theology. I plan to be able to achieve this after the end of the 
                    Spring 2023 semester. That means that I have just this semester and one more before I will graduate. In preparation for graduation, 
                    I have begun to build out my
